<p>I am an Industrial designer from National Institute of Design, Andhra Pradesh. I have a keen interest in Digital Product Design and Design Research. I have previously worked Cogoport on digitizing the freight booking process for sea based logistics.</p>
<p>I see design as a medium to extend my problem solving skills to help elevate the standard of living in society. I love to challenge myself with each new project and try to focus on creating smart and thought provoking work. Its my firm belief that creation of path-breaking products and innovations starts with a persistent desire for a better life combined with keen observation of the human behavior and lifestyle.</p>
<p>In my free time, I can be found sketching people in a street side cafe, enjoying a cup of coffee or reading poetry and romanticizing about life.</p>
